# What I have done here?
- Worked with an in memory database (H2)
- Created three POJOs Author, Book, Publisher
- Converted them in JPA entities
- Connected Author and Book with many to many relation
- Connected Book and Publisher with many to one relation
- Added templates to view books and authors in browser
  available at /books and in /authors using thymeleaf engine

## Below are some snapshots from the H2 console:
